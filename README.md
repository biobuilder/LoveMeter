The Love Meter is a galvanic-sensing, heart-warming educational kit for any electronic enthusiast (and their partner).  To measure love, a pair of users touch the gold-plated terminals with opposing fingers while in contact with each other.  The resulting closed circuit will measure the “conductive strength” of their feelings.  The stronger the feelings, the more LEDs will light up (or so science would suggest, albeit indirectly).
