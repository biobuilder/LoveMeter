The Love Meter is a galvanic-sensing, heart-warming educational kit for any electronic enthusiast (and their partner).  To measure love, a pair of users touch the gold-plated terminals with opposing fingers while in contact with each other.  The resulting closed circuit will measure the “conductive strength” of their feelings.  The stronger the feelings, the more LEDs will light up.  This is a very fine-tuned process, guaranteed to give you 100% accurate results.  Alternatively, if you are alone, you can see how much you love yourself.  You're at least one person you can't live without.  

Please see the Love Meter Assembly Video.
